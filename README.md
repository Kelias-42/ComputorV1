# ComputorV1
Second degree equation solver that displays the equation's degree, reduced form and solutions if they exist.
This is still a work in progress but basic functionalities should work fine.

# Usage
The format accepted by the solver as an argument is very specific: you must enter each coefficients in the "C * X^P" format with C the coefficient and P the power.

Example of a correct input: "5 * X^0 + 4 * X^1 - 9.3 * X^2 = 1 * X^0"
